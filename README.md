# Weather-Notification
This is the first project in the one-month build series.

The one-month build series is a personal series created to gain proficiencies in multiple facets of the software engineering process. As the name suggests each project starts on the first day of the month and ends on the last day of the month. Each project is chosen at random from a spinner wheel. 

This first project is a weather notification program.
